# 🐾 Managed OpenClaw Hosting — Brand & Domain Report

*Prepared by Rohan (Brand Strategist & Domain Hunter) — 10 Feb 2026*

---

## ⚠️ Critical Budget Note

**.ai domains cost ~$93–115/year** on Namecheap (recently increased from ~$80). This exceeds the $8–15 budget. Options:

1. **Go .ai anyway** — it's worth the premium for AI branding (~$93/yr)
2. **Use .io instead** — many available at ~$25–35/yr (still over budget but closer)
3. **Use .com** — $8–12/yr but most good names are taken
4. **Hybrid** — grab the cheap .io now, upgrade to .ai when revenue flows

**Recommendation:** Grab the .ai. For an AI hosting brand, the TLD *is* part of the product. $93/yr is a rounding error once you have paying customers.

## 1. Name Options (Ranked Top 10)

All names below were checked via RDAP for domain availability on 10 Feb 2026.

### 🥇 #1 — ClawPort

| TLD | Status |
|-----|--------|
| clawport.ai | ✅ Likely Available |
| clawport.com | ❌ Registered |
| clawport.io | ✅ Likely Available |

**Why it works:** "Port" evokes deployment (like a shipping port), infrastructure, and is a real tech term. Short (8 chars), easy to say, memorable. Feels like Railway or Render. Directly references "Claw" from OpenClaw.

**Concerns:** .com taken. "Port" slightly overused in tech.

---

### 🥈 #2 — ClawDock

| TLD | Status |
|-----|--------|
| clawdock.ai | ✅ Likely Available |
| clawdock.com | ❌ Registered |
| clawdock.io | ✅ Likely Available |

**Why it works:** "Dock" = deployment + Docker association + "docking" your agent. Clean, punchy, 8 chars. Strong hosting/infra vibes.

**Concerns:** .com taken. Could be confused with Docker-related products.

---

### 🥉 #3 — ClawGrid

| TLD | Status |
|-----|--------|
| clawgrid.ai | ✅ Likely Available |
| clawgrid.com | ❌ Registered |
| clawgrid.io | ✅ Likely Available |

**Why it works:** "Grid" = infrastructure, distributed computing, cloud. Technical but approachable. 8 chars.

**Concerns:** .com taken. Slightly more "enterprise" feeling than startup-y.

---

### #4 — ClawRelay

| TLD | Status |
|-----|--------|
| clawrelay.ai | ✅ Likely Available |
| clawrelay.com | ❌ Registered |
| clawrelay.io | ✅ Likely Available |

**Why it works:** "Relay" implies passing messages, running continuously, always-on agents. 9 chars. Unique in the space.

**Concerns:** .com taken. Slightly longer.

---

### #5 — ClawBolt

| TLD | Status |
|-----|--------|
| clawbolt.ai | ✅ Likely Available |
| clawbolt.com | ❌ Registered |
| clawbolt.io | ✅ Likely Available |

**Why it works:** "Bolt" = speed, lightning, instant deployment. Energy and urgency. 8 chars. Feels like Vercel's speed-obsessed branding.

**Concerns:** .com taken. Bolt is a common brand name (Bolt.com, etc.).

---

### #6 — ClawShift

| TLD | Status |
|-----|--------|
| clawshift.ai | ✅ Likely Available |
| clawshift.com | ❌ Registered |
| clawshift.io | ✅ Likely Available |

**Why it works:** "Shift" = transformation, moving to cloud, paradigm shift. Modern, clean. 9 chars.

**Concerns:** .com taken. "Shift" is abstract — less obviously about hosting.

---

### #7 — ClawWave

| TLD | Status |
|-----|--------|
| clawwave.ai | ✅ Likely Available |
| clawwave.com | ❌ Registered |
| clawwave.io | ✅ Likely Available |

**Why it works:** "Wave" = the next wave of AI, smooth, flowing. Sounds premium and forward-looking.

**Concerns:** .com taken. Slightly more consumer than developer-oriented.

---

### #8 — ClawLane

| TLD | Status |
|-----|--------|
| clawlane.ai | ✅ Likely Available |
| clawlane.com | ❌ Registered |
| clawlane.io | ✅ Likely Available |

**Why it works:** "Lane" = fast lane, dedicated path, clear route. Simple, human, easy to spell. 8 chars. Unique in the hosting space.

**Concerns:** .com taken. Less "tech" sounding.

---

### #9 — ClawWing

| TLD | Status |
|-----|--------|
| clawwing.ai | ✅ Likely Available |
| clawwing.com | ❌ Registered |
| clawwing.io | ✅ Likely Available |

**Why it works:** "Wing" = flight (Fly.io vibes), support ("take under our wing"), expansion. Claw + Wing = creature that flies. 8 chars.

**Concerns:** .com taken. Double-W might cause typos.

---

### #10 — ClawStacker

| TLD | Status |
|-----|--------|
| clawstacker.ai | ✅ Likely Available |
| clawstacker.com | ✅ Likely Available |
| clawstacker.io | ✅ Likely Available |

**Why it works:** **All three TLDs available.** "Stacker" = stacking services, building blocks. Tech-forward.

**Concerns:** 11 chars — longest name. Sounds more like a dev tool than a cloud brand. Could shorten to "ClawStack" but that's taken.

## 3. Tagline Options

### Primary (pick one for hero):

1. **"Your AI agent. Our infrastructure."**
   — Clean, Vercel-esque. Draws the line: you own the agent, we handle the rest.

2. **"Deploy your AI agent in 60 seconds."**
   — Specific, bold, speed-focused. Implies zero complexity.

3. **"Managed OpenClaw. Zero DevOps."**
   — Direct, solves the pain point. Technical audience knows exactly what this is.

### Secondary (for sub-hero or features section):

4. **"The fastest way to your own AI."**
   — Aspirational, consumer-friendly. Good for less technical audiences.

5. **"Set up once. Run forever."**
   — Emphasizes reliability and the "always-on" nature of agents.

## 4. Brand Voice Recommendation

### Tone: **Calm confidence**

Think Vercel, Linear, Raycast. Not loud. Not salesy. Just... competent.

### Principles:

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| "Deploy in 60 seconds" | "AMAZING AI HOSTING!!!" |
| "We handle infrastructure" | "We're the #1 best platform" |
| "Your agent, always on" | "Revolutionary game-changing AI" |
| Use specifics (60s, 99.9% uptime) | Use superlatives without proof |
| Short sentences. White space. | Walls of text. Feature dumps. |

### Voice characteristics:

- **Minimal** — Say less. Mean more. Every word earns its place.
- **Technical but human** — Developers are the audience but don't gatekeep with jargon.
- **Confident, not arrogant** — "We handle this well" not "Nobody does this better."
- **Action-oriented** — CTAs are verbs: Deploy, Connect, Launch. Not "Learn more."

### Color/aesthetic direction:

- Dark mode default (like Vercel, Linear)
- Monospace for code/technical elements
- One accent color (electric blue, soft purple, or amber)
- Generous whitespace
- Subtle gradients, no busy patterns

### Example landing page copy:

> **ClawPort**
>
> Your AI agent. Our infrastructure.
>
> Deploy a fully managed OpenClaw instance in 60 seconds.
> No servers. No config. No DevOps.
>
> [Deploy Now] [View Pricing]

## 🎯 Final Recommendation

### Go with: **ClawPort.ai**

**Why:**
- Short, memorable, professional
- "Port" is universally understood (shipping port, network port, airport)
- Direct "Claw" reference ties it to OpenClaw without being derivative
- Both .ai and .io available — grab both
- Sounds like it belongs next to Vercel, Railway, and Render
- Easy to say in conversation: *"Just deploy it on ClawPort"*

**Action items:**
1. Register `clawport.ai` (~$93) — primary domain
2. Register `clawport.io` (~$30) — redirect to .ai
3. If budget is truly hard-capped at $15, register `clawport.io` now and upgrade later
4. Verify availability on Namecheap before someone else grabs it

**Runner-up:** ClawDock.ai — equally strong, Docker-adjacent branding.
